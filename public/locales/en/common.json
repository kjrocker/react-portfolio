      "I am a professional web developer focused on Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. I have been coding in some capacity for as long as I can remember, only beginning my professional career in late 2016 with Levvel.\n\nI thrive on challenge and system engineering, always keeping the big picture and return-on-investment in mind when making or suggesting changes. I also have a proven ability to explain myself at a non-technical level whenever necessary, which comes in handy rather often!",

Whether it's talking with co-workers at a meeting, or just in everyday interactions with other human beings, I have a smile and a joke for anyone who wants one."
